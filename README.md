List of things that I'd love to work on

### Interesting Concepts
- Geomagnetic storms
- Terraforming
- Asteroid defense
- Warp drive
- Teleportation
- Anti-gravity
- Quantum entanglement
- Wormhole

### Project Ideas
##### Physics

- A framework for creating new universes from scratch by defining different laws of physics
- A heat map that compares how time flows in different parts of the known universe and solar system
- Simulating how aliens would see the world in different wavelengths + how our daily lives look in different wavelengths

##### AI

- So BCIs can decode neural signals to text. Can we decode a model's parameters to a model's prediction?
- An activation function as a neural network
- A loss function for self-awareness
- A dataset to train a neural network for general intelligence"
