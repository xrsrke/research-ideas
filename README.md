List of things that I'd love to work on


### Physics
- Heat map that compare how time flows in different part of known universe and solar system
- Simulate how alien will see the world in different wavelength + How our daily lives looks in different wavelength


### AI
- So BCI can decode neural's signal to text. Can we decode model's parameters to model's prediction?
